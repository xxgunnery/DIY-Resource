                                <p>For this step, you are going to need your large piece of 3” PVC. Grab a tape measure and measure out 6 feet on the PVC, marking a line using a permanent marker.</p>
                                <p>Set the PVC on your work bench and bring it to the edge. Use your clamps to hold the PVC to the bench and then proceed to cut the PVC with your coping saw. Use quick motions and make sure to keep your cut straight.</p>

You should end up with two 4.5” sections of PVC. These will serve as the handles to your PVC Workout Bar.</p>

                                <p>For this step, you are going to be referring to a YouTube video I’ve made which details how to tie a double fisherman’s knot. You are going to be using this knot to tie your paracord pieces into loops.</p>
                                <p>Get your two pieces of 4 foot paracord and then follow the steps in the video linked in the description to tie the two ends of the loop together. Once the double fisherman’s knot is tied, stretch your loops out on the table and measure the length of the loop.</p>
                                <p>With the loop stretched fully like you are pulling a rubber band, you should get a measurement of at least 16” on the paracord if you are using a 3” diameter PVC. This measurement is a recommendation based on my use of the PVC Workout Bar. You should make your own adjustments in loop length when you attach the loop to your 6’ PVC in step 5 (the next step).</p>

                                <p>In this step, your job is to weave your paracord loops through the two ¾” diameter pieces of PVC that you cut in step 2. After the loops are through the PVC, they are placed on the large 6’ length of PVC which you cut in step 1.</p>
                                <p>To weave your paracord loops through the ¾” pieces of PVC, stretch the loop out like you are pulling a rubber band and then push the loop through the center. You should have two loose strands of the loop on both sides of the PVC pieces. This is your PVC handle.</p>
                                <p>Once both handles are made, you can attach them to the long 6’ PVC by stretching the loose ends of the loops on the handles and sliding them over the longer piece of PVC. Do this for both handles. The handles should not yet be fixed on the PVC, this will be done in step 8.</p>

                                <p>For this step, you will need your bucket filled with sand, your scooper/garden trowel, your funnel, one of the PVC end caps and the long 6’ section of PVC you cut in step 1, with the handles.</p>
                                <p>First, tightly place your PVC end cap on the pipe. You can use a mallet to ensure that the end cap is placed as tightly as possible. You do not want this end cap to fall off, as that will mean a major spill!</p>
                                <p>Once the end cap is placed and is tight, tilt the chamber upwards on your desk, or place it on the floor and life it up. You will then use your scooper and funnel to shovel sand into the pipe until it is full. In step 8, we are going to put the final end cap on the pipe. You may do this now, however.</p>

                                <p>With the chamber completely filled with sand, place your final end cap on to seal the chamber. Once again, ensure that this is tight before you decide to use the workout bar.</p>
                                <p>To finish this last step, grab your roll of duct tape and rip off two 6” sections as well as two thin (quartered) 10” sections.</p>
                                <p>I found that a very cost effective and easy way to fix the handles to the PVC was to apply two pieces of duct tape to the handles. One of the pieces of duct tape was placed in such a way that it looped around the edges of the paracord resting on the opposite side of the bar from the PVC handles. This placement of duct tape allows us to use it as an anchor point for a second piece of duct tape which holds the handle in place on the bar. This second piece simply sticks the first piece of duct tape to the bar, holding it in place.</p>
                                <p>When fixing the handles to the bar, make sure that they are spaced in such a way that you can comfortably grab the handles and balance the bar. To find this location for myself, I stood facing the center of the bar and then marked two places, approximately shoulder-width apart.</p>
